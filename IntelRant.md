# Intel CEO & managers are fucking dumb
Why you ask? Well that's because bastards can't fucking name their CPUs properly!

Like I know sometimes you need change but the change should be such that it removes the cool, sassy, or useful part of the product. Which is exactly what they are doing!

Now, honestly, I ain't going on how their CPUs **slightly** under perform when slapped with a single threaded load, cuz I ain't ever gonna acquire up the wealth to ever have that kinda fortune.  
Seemingly, a wake up call for the billionaire tech bros who only deal with **Intel i9 14900 KS** (Thanks for looting mah money bitch!) and blabber dog shit about its features instead of actually focusing on practicality... (Yea, LTT you are one of these same retarded bastards!)

## So wtf is the problem with Intel?
Well, uh, naming dumb ass!  
When you ain't having the wealth to bitch on "how this diddly CPU is marginally slower in this other CPU" you have just a few things to care:
1. Does it do the work of doing the process?
2. Does the fucking logo and the name give you a sense of satisfaction or "coolness" and can you make out how the things work for the CPU?
3. Is it cheap?

The "intel 15th generation" checks each and every of this questions so quickly and with such a big cross that its mind numbing!

For the past 10+ years you had the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, ... 14th generation with the characteristic "i[3, 5, 7, 9]" name which, honestly sounded cool!

For example, for the processor "Intel Core i7 12700k"
You can have a multitude of really cool names like: "Intel i7 12700K" or "i7 12700K" or "Core i7 12700" or "i7 12th Gen" or "12th i7" or even, "i7"

And now you have: "Intel Core Ultra 9 Processor 288V"
What name can you fucking make up for this? "Ultra 9"?, "Ultra 9 28"? "Ultra 9 288V"?
**BITCH ALL OF THESE ARE LAME AS FUCK compared to the "i" convention**

I mean, "Intel Core i9 15600" actually objectively sounds cool and satisfying compared to this core ultra dog shit!

Like the "i" and the big "15" (or 14, etc) just sounds so much in sync and cooler that "9" & "28"

And guess what? (though this is a lesser concern) You suddenly don't know wtf as 288 means, wtf a "V" means in this line!

So guess what? Intel, you have a couple of dumb bitches sitting on the top, spreading their booty cheeks faaar and wide just to expand the anus as much as possible and shitting out absolute rotten shit! This shit isn't even fucking acceptable! For fucks sake! Hire someone who knows how to brand and name the fucking product, this is a big part of marketing too!
